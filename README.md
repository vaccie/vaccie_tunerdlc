# vaccie_tunerdlc

A simple script for FiveM that allows the possibility to put the stance and the lowgrip wheels (Los Santos Tuners DLC) with 2 commands:

/stance<br>
/lowgrip

<b>To make the script work correctly you will need to force the last gameBuild (2372), just put this "set sv_enforceGameBuild 2372" in the server.cfg</b>
